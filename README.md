# Sparse Toolkit

A PyTorch library for sparse matrices.

## Installation

We recommend using NGC's `nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:21.12-py3` PyTorch container and using the pre-built `.whl` under [dist](https://github.com/tgale96/stk/tree/main/dist).

For other environments, please follow the steps outlined in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/tgale96/stk/blob/main/Dockerfile).
